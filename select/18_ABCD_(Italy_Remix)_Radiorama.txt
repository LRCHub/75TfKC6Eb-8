Funny world for me
Don't you know I'm crazy
Baby don't be lazy
Get up and run
You are getting older
But I'm feeling stronger

Don't kill your dreams and no fear
Let's get away from valley deep!

Walking up and down
Rolling on the ceiling
Baby how you feeling?
And I will rock you
I will take you higher
I am not a liar

Don't kill your dreamsand no fear
Let's get away from valley deep!

A, B, C, D
Gone away my friends
You too were singing out
Living the fantasy
A, B, C, D
You can hear the willful
Looking round your door

Baby you're not too afraid
Don't you believe in my world?
Won't you say
Don't you believe in my world?

Walking up and down
Rolling on the ceiling
Baby how you feeling?
Get up and run
I will take you higher
I am not a liar

Don't kill your dreams and no fear
Let's get away from valley deep!
